Breast Cancer Prediction Project

Overview:
This project is a Django-based web application designed to support breast cancer prediction and analysis. It provides a user interface for submitting patient data and delivers trained model predictions to help identify potential breast cancer cases.

Key Features:
- Django web application structure with a dedicated prediction app
- Model training and prediction workflow
- Clean frontend templates for user interaction
- Built-in administration and routing for easy navigation

Dependencies:
- Django 3.1.1
- asttokens 3.0.1
- attrs 26.1.0
- backcall 0.2.0
- beautifulsoup4 4.15.0
- bleach (version unspecified)

Setup Instructions:
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Apply database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`.
4. Create a superuser if administration access is needed: `python manage.py createsuperuser`.
5. Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`.

Usage:
- Open the application in a browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
- Use the homepage to submit data and view prediction results.
- Access the Django admin interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` when logged in.

Project Structure:
- `breast_cancer_project/`: Django project settings and configuration
- `predictor/`: Main application containing views, models, URLs, and templates
- `data.csv`: Dataset file used for training or analysis
- `db.sqlite3`: SQLite database file for local development
- `manage.py`: Django command-line utility

Notes:
- Update the `requirements.txt` file if additional dependencies are required for model training or deployment.
- For production deployment, configure proper security settings, static file handling, and a production-ready database.

For questions or further development, review the project files and application logic within the `predictor/` app and `breast_cancer_project/` configuration.
